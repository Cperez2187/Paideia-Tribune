author: "Anthony KaDarrell Thigpen "
about: Media is my vice, but spirituality, family-time, reading, writing,
  photography, and helping others are the activities I take very seriously.
  Veganism and positivity give me creative inspiration. I'm an introvert, but
  most people are unaware of that because I laugh a lot, smile even more, and
  love humanity. My life is usually quiet and straightforward, and then
  something amazingly awesome happens out of nowhere. After serving on the Gulf
  War's frontlines in Iraq, I studied journalism and theology at the University
  of St. Thomas. As a Higher Education Consortium on Urban Affairs (HECUA)
  alumni, the Northwest Indiana Post-Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times sent me on
  domestic and foreign news assignments for the next 15 years. With hopes of
  illustrating more intimate stories, photography, poetry, and publishing
  sprouted as my passions. These gifts enable me to continue traveling
  worldwide. Blogging is a tool I use to raise autism awareness and to highlight
  other unique topics. The favor I receive from countless beautiful and
  brilliant people is humbling. Most importantly, I'm mindful of maximizing
  every experience life grants me.
