LONDON, ENGLAND , The United Kingdom  

(STAMPED May 28, 2019/5:18 p.m.) – So, we landed in London. 

With a sense of freedom from responsibility mixed with the anxiety of being a foreigner, we secured our luggage, some Pounds (UK Currency), maneuvered to our nearby hotel and purchased Oyster Cards to navigate around beautiful England. My best friend, Ernest, and his lifelong love, Sunny, just happened to be in London as well. 

So, of course we had to hang out for dinner and drinks! 

We reminisced at a tasty restaurant in Central London called, Jinjuu, located at 15 Kingly St, Soho, London W1B 5PS. The food there is amazing, including the gourmet vegan options! We shared stories with Amber about the good old days! It doesn’t seem that long ago when cellular phones didn’t exist, mailing letters was the norm, rotary phones, TV went off at midnight, and the southward shift of R&B lyrics. 

The evening was spiraled upward with lots of laughter and countless connections that made our experience in London all that more enriching. 

Afterward, we continued sightseeing and navigating the London public transportation system. London is very unique in that it’s government is a long established monarchy! 

Much like the U.S. prints the faces of deceased Presidents on our bills, London’s currency is adorned with the presiding Queen. It has a rich meaningful history to many Americans, because the founders of the United States explored the new world only with permission of the monarch. 

So much of our country has roots in their history, even its ancestry. 

Our language, infrastructure, culture and so much of our history is rooted in British concepts. 

My daughter connected this reality to a popular line in her 5th grade play, from 2 years ago, “The British are coming the British are coming”. 

While America fought for its independence, we will never break-free from the culture that is entangled into the fibers of our constitutional values and historic landmarks. The monuments and memories of London are a reminder of American history at its onset. Today was an amazing experience. We have so much more to share and Amber is absorbing it all firsthand! 

We may have landed, but it feel like our feet haven’t touched the ground – we’re having a blast!





\    (STAMPED May 26, 2019/11 a.m.) – After one year of planning, securing passports, conducting research, purchasing plane and train tickets, booking hotel rooms in 13 countries, it is time to take flight.

Our flight is about to depart in less than 2 hours; Clara, Amber and myself are at Delta Airline’s gate F8 ready to see the world. 

Traveling in important to us!

“It’s a gateway to explore about culture, history and people,” said Clara Thigpen. “I’ve always been fascinated with other cultures because they are different from mine.”

As a family, we are humbled and grateful to have the opportunity and privilege to be able to travel to various continents – we don’t take it for granted. 

“I get to learn about history from around the world by actually seeing it hands-on,” Amber said. “A lot of what we see and do in American is based on European history.”
