(STAMPED May 26, 2019/11 a.m.) – After one year of planning, securing passports, conducting research, purchasing plane and train tickets, booking hotel rooms in 13 countries, it is time to take flight.

Our flight is about to depart in less than 2 hours; Clara, Amber and myself are at Delta Airline’s gate F8 ready to see the world. 

Traveling in important to us!

“It’s a gateway to explore about culture, history and people,” said Clara Thigpen. “I’ve always been fascinated with other cultures because they are different from mine.”

As a family, we are humbled and grateful to have the opportunity and privilege to be able to travel to various continents – we don’t take it for granted. 

“I get to learn about history from around the world by actually seeing it hands-on,” Amber said. “A lot of what we see and do in American is based on European history.”

Authentic experiences outside of the textbook is what Clara and I hope to gift our daughter with.

“It’s one thing to read about it or see it on TV,” Clara said. “It’s a different kind of experience when you can see things in real life.”

Travel with us on this journey as we share our experiences and pictures through this Paideia-Tribune blog.  

As a family, we each created individual travel scrapbooks, packed lightly, and planned for the best and the worst, knowing that everything is going to work on our behalf. 

Check-in with us, simply by clicking this same link daily, as we plan to date and time stamp something exciting for you to see and read from 13 uniquely different countries.

So, use google maps to join our journey to the following places: London, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Croatia, Hungary, Austria, Czech Republic, Berlin and Luxembourg. 

We’ve started our morning travel day with some nondairy Starbucks, of course vegan French fries and hydrating water. Listening to some Daniel Ceasar, watching planes take off, and ready to depart the beautiful blue skies of Arizona.

It’s time to go, we’ll chat with you guys on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean - Ready, set, let-go!
