**THE THINK TANK**, *Elevating Consciousness* – The absolute most difficult aspect of learning is undertaking the process of unlearning in order to live your best life.

Unlearning opinion-based thoughts, faulty information and strategies hinged on emotional appeal all demand a committed effort. 

To some degree, during our adolescent years, we’ve all been brainwashed. 

Our indoctrination into mainstream society infuses cultural content into the fibers of how we think. 

From language, holidays, recipes, to apparel and religion, our identity is psychologically invented in our environment and prescribed through influences.  

It is often said, “When you know better, you do better.” However, that cliché is much easier said than done. 

In fact, without an asserted effort, this cliché couldn’t be further from the truth. 

The journey to becoming the best you possible begins within the mind, but ends with each experience that empowers us to break free from expected norms.

First, there is an internal debate that must be had; an analysis that must take place and questions that demand answers.

In order to transform into our best possible selves, we must embrace the reality the we are created to live life as thinking individuals. 

“What are you trying to prove,” “What do you have to go on,” and “How did you get from evidence to claim?” These are the three practical questions philosopher Stephen Toulmin suggest that individuals use in and out of the classroom when trying to create an effective model of argument. 

When in pursuit to perfect our passion in any area of life, the process begins with an uneasy and uncomfortable willingness to change the way we think. During the season of unlearning, it’s best to gain comfort being uncomfortable. 

By nature, change is difficult. Altering your thoughts and lifestyle is no easy task. 

It requires an efficient and effective differentiation between fact vs. opinion, cause vs. affect, moral vs. theme, and emotion vs. logic. This decision process is challenging and convoluted, yet well worth the reward of liberating oneself as an independent thinker and free-spirit.  

Start with taking a close analysis of your life. 

Use supporting materials, experiences, facts, and relationships to define a detailed analysis.

Afterward, formulate a sense of logical organization. Be true to yourself – you must be your own credible source. 

Like a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly, once your thoughts become clear, you’ll experience a metamorphosis.

Unhinging the chains of meaningless experiences, releasing painful memories, and detaching oneself from counter-productive relationships start with logical organization. 

Health, happiness, intellectual, social, emotional and spiritual-wellness are all pathways to growth, purpose and healing.

I’m convinced that one of the most critical corridors of human growth adults will undertake is the experience of unlearning.
