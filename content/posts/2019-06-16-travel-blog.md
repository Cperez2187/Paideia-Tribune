# A REAL FATHER 

![](/images/uploads/jude-beck-552276-unsplash.jpg)

 Fathers are the trunk of the family tree - a true father has to be deeply rooted and grounded, because all the nutrients takes place at the base. 

The implementation process and the continued watering and gestation process, are essential to the development of a strong solid tree.

 If the base is strong and the branches are strong and durable, they the tree can sustain the storms and strong winds of life. 

Fathers, real fathers are the men that we celebrate today.

 A Real Father is more than a seed fertilizer.

 A Real Father is more than a trophy dad. 

A Real Father is someone who takes responsibility for the well being of his family. 

A Real Father is someone whom provides for his family. 

A Real Father is someone whom protects his family. 

A Real Father is someone whom supports and celebrate his family successes.

 A Real Father is someone whom make necessary sacrifices for his family.

 A Real Father is someone whom leaves a inheritance for his children’s children. A Real Father is there to pick you up when you fall. 

A Real Father is someone whom gives you wisdom and understanding. 

A Real Father is someone whom believes in you when no one else will. 

A Real Father is willing to share the pain of their children. A Real Father will forgive you when you make a mistake. 

A Real Father won’t abuse or disrespect the bodies of their children or the children of others. 

A Real Father is someone whom would sacrifice His only Son to save many.  

Let’s Follow The Example Of Our Real Father.

Happy Father’s Day
