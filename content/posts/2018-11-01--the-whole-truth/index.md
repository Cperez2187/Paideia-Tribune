The language accredited to Christianity often falls upon deaf ears. Many churchgoers are biblically unknowledgeable.

The vernacular associated with the Bible rings of the halls of theological seminaries. Since the turn of the 20th century, individuals who study the Bible possess a unique understanding from those who simply possess it. 

The antiquated biblical term that defines this understanding is called doctrine. It is largely attributed to biblical study and exploration. Doctrine is not applied to any other academic discipline.

Doctrine is a word the Christian should relish because it fortifies sound living and prevents a frivolous and inconsistent existence.

## What is Doctrine?

Doctrine is a clear and consistent line of thought. It is a system of teaching. Doctrine is specific and fully discloses concrete ideas about a particular subject.  

## Why have Doctrine?

Doctrine is an imperative and vital organism in the life-line of a Christian. Upon confession of Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, doctrine is the guide for Christian life.

The Christian lifestyle is unparalleled with any other. The Christian is born again — proclaiming a new life. With a fresh start, we are being made into the image of Christ. 

When the Christian confesses Christ as Lord and Savior, we are born-again of the incorruptible seed.  
   
Christ, with no earthly father, and born of a virgin, was inseminated by the Holy Spirit. The seed that fertilized Mary’s egg was the Holy Spirit. This is why Christ is fully God and fully human.  

By faith in Him alone, the Christian is born again of the Spirit. This covenant is settled at the point of confession.  In addition, there’s more to come for the Christian. Once confession is made, the believer begins to learn the details of this new birth. The newly born Christian begins a systemic process. 

This systemic education is called doctrine.

There are many doctrines that are applicable to the Christian. As water is to the human body, doctrine is to the soul of the Christian. Get ready for an invigorating exploration of Christian doctrine.

Throughout this blog series on doctrine, “**GLOVES OFF**, *Religion, Race, & Reasoning*” will explore the relevance of sound biblical doctrines.
