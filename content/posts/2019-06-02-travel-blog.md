# HILTON HOTELS ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL

## (TIME STAMPED: Tuesday, June 11, 2019/8:50 p.m.)

**TRAVEL BLOG -**   Hilton is unquestionably a great lodging option, especially when traveling abroad. 

 In tradition of saving the best for last, let me start by giving you some need-to-know information about Hilton Hotels.

 Hotels should be judged by a combination of qualities, like hospitality, food, beverages, pricing, room accommodations and general location – oh, and of course regional competition. 

 After doing business with Hilton Hotels in the United States, London, Amsterdam, France, Switzerland, Italy, Croatia, Hungary, Austria, Germany and Luxembourg, I’ve paid the price to have an educated opinion. 

 About 4 of these Hotels were last-minute-overseas-non refundable-prepaid cancelations. 

 However, each of these Hotels canceled my stay and refunded my payment the same day, without any penalties.  This type of unexpected courtesy is one of the reasons I prefer hotels like Hilton. 

This article is not a paid endorsement.

 I simply called the Hilton Honors 1-800 number and the representatives successfully went to work on my behalf.

Stateside assistance 24/7 especially helps when members are over 5000 miles from home, in a different time zone.

Some operators obviously have bad days, because one Hilton employee with a strong Asian accent by the name of Gayle B. was shockingly rude.

She wouldn’t help me, wouldn’t transfer me to a supervisor, wouldn’t allow me to speak to a co-worker, wouldn’t take a message, wouldn’t give me any options, and wouldn’t give me any identifying employee information.

Perhaps Gayle B. shouldn’t work for Hilton customer service. After dealing with Hilton Hotel employees internationally, she was one of Hilton’s worse employees worldwide, literally speaking.  

 Oh, did I mention that I’m a member of Hilton Hotels loyalty program.

During our recent travels, we concluded that Hilton Hotels aren’t created equal. Hilton categorize their hotels according to 14 brand with distinct characteristics.

 You’ve probably heard of a few, the Doubletree, Embassy Suites and Hilton Garden Inn, just to name a few. 

 Some of these Hotels offer relaxing resort style living and others are nothing more than poorly put together pit stops.  

Here are some of our recent experiences.

Our room in London was too small, although that’s not completely unusual for European style accommodations.

 However, it is falsely advertised as an airport hotel - thankfully we came prepared for curb balls.

 The front desk concierge gave us bad directions - but we always ask around, use Google map and write down navigation instructions.

 Other than that, at least the hot breakfast put a complimentary meal on our stomachs to start our day – I’d actually return as a much happier guest now that I know what to expect.

 I can’t say the same about the Hilton in Barcelona, I was quoted a price for my room, but upon arrival they changed our accommodations and the price.

 The desk clerk repeatedly said our breakfast was complimentary, but it wasn’t – only had we learned that prior to eating.

To make matters worse, the Hilton employees in Barcelona don’t quite understand the concept of hospitality. 

 While the beautiful hotel was in a safe area, this miscommunication can inconvenience a 3-week budgeted trip.  This is why we factored extra cash flow into our budget. 

Italy and Rome Hilton Hotels have something in common, you’d better be prepared to take public transportation or pay high taxi fees. 

 These hotels are no where near any of the tourist attractions as advertised.

 While you get a better feel for how the natives live, which I prefer, some people might not feel safe in these neighborhoods. 

 Both rooms were comfortable, the staffing was exceptional, and breakfast at both was complimentary, clean and tasty.

A simple online Hilton travel guide would have helped eliminate concerns, especially while traveling as a family.

Now some Hilton Hotels need far more than a travel guide, for example, the Luxembourg Hilton should be shutdown. 

Hilton Luxembourg left us at a loss, even my 13-year-old daughter was disappointed. 

Look, I like a firm mattress, but beds shouldn’t sleep like carpeted concrete floors.

The food experience was frightening. The head waitress is unquestionably ill-mannered, the drinks are overpriced, and the restaurant feels like an uninviting cold cafeteria with slow service.

If you’re hungry, be prepared to wait, and wait, and wait… don’t be quick to start stuffing yourself with dinner rolls either.

We watched a waitress drop several items on the floor, yep, even a dinner roll, only to have them served to other guests.

To add injury to insult, chips of glass slapped against my face when one nearby waitress dropped her platter.

Now, as for the rooms, I thought we were on candid camera and this was some sort of end-of-our-journey joke.

The internet moves like molasses, the hidden away hotel offers weekend-only shuttle services back to civilization, and the keycard is guaranteed to stop working – so get a new one before taking the aged-old elevator to the 8th floor.

After being here one night, the cleaning crew knocked on the door informing my wife that our stay was over. Hours later, the front desk called sternly insisting that we checkout. After a polite reminder, the staff triple checked our reservation, only to discover that we’d prepaid for a 2 night stay months. 

Hilton Luxembourg left nothing to be desired. In fact, Hilton ought to be to ashamed to have this establishment representing their name without making some serious enhancements.

They need hospitality training, new chefs, new waitresses, a maintenance review, new hotel strategies, a food, beverage and room pricing assessment, better mattresses, better internet and some basic remodeling. 

It’s not even worth a rating, because it certainly doesn’t compare to the chain of Hilton hotels we’ve occupied over the past 3 weeks in Europe.

As promised, I’ve saved the best for last. 

 Zürich Switzerland and Vienna Austria were our favorite Hilton choices throughout Europe. 

 These hotels had the largest rooms, best service, most delicious food and tasty beverages. 

Our Switzerland blog bragged about the brilliant Zurich Hilton staff, now let’s discuss the hotel that inspired this Hilton-only blog.  

Our bartender in Vienna was the amazing Anna. 

 She went to “The First Austrian Bartending School” and it must’ve truly paid off.

 Anna says she likes bartending because it allows her to make drinks fresh, strong, sweet, salty or however the customer likes it. 

And I liked it!

 “It’s like cooking with liquids,” she explained. “I have many of my own creations.” 

 While visiting the same Hilton restaurant, Emile Plaza, we met junior sous chef, Kai – the highlight of our evening is from South Korea, but trained in a Berlin based culinary school. 

 Like Ana, Kai has such a love for his profession and people that you can feel their welcoming energy.

 Kai says he actually dedicated 30 days to different diets, from vegan and vegetarian to Paleo and Ketogenic. 

 With high hopes of making Hilton guests happy, Kai has experimented with many unique diets. 

 He prepared a picture perfect vegan feast for my family that we will always cherish – it was so delicious that my wife said, “It makes me want to slap my momma” – not that she’d ever slap my mother-in-love. 

 Janet was another restaurant worker who came over with the food and beverage supervisor Jan to make us feel welcomed. 

The entire staff was well trained and simply the best.

The Hilton Vienna and Zurich Hilton have hypnotizing hospitality that leave guests craving another visit.

When compared to places like Luxembourg, the staff, services and facilities in Zurich and Vienna provide proof that all Hilton Hotels are not created equal.

# HISTORY OF THE HOLOCAUST IN AUSTRIA   

## (TIME STAMPED: Monday, June 10, 2019/11:45 p.m.)

**TRAVEL BLOG -**  European vacation is vacillating between an educational field trip and a summer of fun.  

As with any international journey, Europe enriched us with life lessons, authentic experiences, and meaningful connections between reading and reality. 

Recently, we stayed in the old town area of the original district of Vienna, Austria. 

The single district city was once surrounded by walls - defensive walls that were demolished in 1853.  

Now, Vienna has 23 districts.  In the past, it was one of the most multi-ethnic cities on earth – a melting pot of immigrants from across the empire. 

Adolf Hitler went to college in Vienna from 1908-1913. He is often described as half man and half monster.  

Hitler was a great leader who did horrible things. He built the Nazis Party and his ring of evil.  

He is responsible for the deaths of 6 million Jewish people, during the Holocaust. 

The Holocaust was the mass slaughter of European civilians and especially Jews by the Nazis during World War II. 

On March 12, 1938, German troops marched into Austria to annex the German-speaking nation of Austria. 

 Jews, Poles, Gypsies and other members of the population considered racially impure, were forced into labor roles, beaten, placed in gas chambers, and displaced into concentration camps. 

 Many museums throughout the city mark this gruesome history. 

 A 1965 American musical drama titled “The Sounds of Music” depicts a kid-friendly version of the 1938 tragedies during Nazism. 

 Watching this movie prior to visiting Vienna, provided our daughter with a better understanding.

 If we don’t know history, we are inclined to vote for leaders who will cause us to repeat it.  

Austria today is a beautiful and diverse place.  

The people are kind, considerate, welcoming and accommodating.  

The old town area is occupied by 200 year-old buildings that stood throughout the war. 

Our experience in Vienna was relaxing, peaceful and enlightening.  

The hotel accommodations, food and beverages were so delicious that we decided to write a special blog. 

Our readers need to know that “All Hilton’s Are Not Created Equal”. 

 We’ve arrived safely in Berlin, and our 3 week European tour is spiraling to a rapid end. 

However, we are taking a trip to the country that held the highest GDP for years.  

Luxembourg will be our 10th country to visit the lifestyle of one of the richest nations. 

We’re taking a tour of the countryside of Germany while in route to our destination – Clara and Amber got an opportunity to see the region where I served in the military years ago.

I took pictures of our old stomping grounds and sent them to 5 of my life-long military brothers. 

Considering that we altered our trip to spend more time in France and Italy, we now have a reason to return. 

This has already been the most meaningful trip of a lifetime, and it’s not even over!

# SMALLEST COUNTRY WORLDWIDE 

## (TIME STAMPED: Satuday, June 8, 2019/5:00 p.m.)

**TRAVEL BLOG -** We’ve been on the Continent of Europe 14 days, and our 5 days in Italy proved perfect for sightseeing, shopping and satisfying our appetite. 

Now we’re heading to the country of Austria to visit the beautiful city of Vienna.

Before leaving Italy, we felt inspired to visit the smallest country in the world - Vatican City. 

Yes, Vatican City is a sovereign country – the seat of the Catholic Holy See – the Roman Catholic Pope.

Vatican City allowed us to gain greater insights about the Catholic empire.

Don't worry, we didn't convert. 

Although we did cough up the cash to skip the lines to visit the Sistine Chapel, St. Peter’s Basilica, and the Vatican Museums. 

The $70 per person is well worth it. 

The Sistine Chapel is the place where high priests assemble to select new Popes.

World renowned artist Michael Angelo is noted for painting every inch of the chapel, even the ceiling. 

However, he wasn’t the only artist, it is seldom mentioned, but others also contributed to the work of art that 20 million tourists visit annually. 

The art in the Sistine Chapel depicts Christian history, based on the Bible, from Genesis to the last judgment. 

The detail and craftsmanship is simply astonishing. 

St. Peter’s Basilica is the place where the Apostle Peter is buried, the disciple who wrote 13 books of the New Testament Bible. 

Others are buried their as well.

The amazing Museums and huge hallways are overwhelmingly breathtaking. 

Visiting Vatican City is a country well-worth your stop - especially if you're already heading to Rome anyway.

Standing within the main square, where the Pope delivers many of his balcony speeches, is an original Egyptian Obelisk. 

It is actually 1 of the 13 original obelisk from the antiquity era. 

At least eight obelisks created by Egyptians were taken from Egypt after the Roman conquest. 

So, if you ever want to see the largest standing ancient Egyptian obelisk in the world, you’ll have to take a tour of Rome. 

Upon leaving the gates of Vatican City, we continued touring countless locations in Rome.

We even entered the famous Pantheon and took pictures of the open sky ceiling. 

While touring ancient landmarks, we ate more pizza, more pasta and more gelato than we ever anticipated - and we have no regrets.

We also shopped for shoes, clothes and jewelry - I'll calculate those regrets upon my return. 

Italy proved to be one of our favorite places on the planet once again. 

As we say goodbye, boarding our first-class high speed train heading to Vienna, Austria, we can officially say, "When in Rome, we did as the Romans."

# ROME IS RIVETING

## (TIME STAMPED: Thursday, June 6, 2019/12:30 a.m.)

**TRAVEL BLOG -** Where are my gladiators? If you like movies like Gladiator, Troy, Spartacus, Kingdom of Heaven, Robin Hood, or 300: Rise of an Empire, then visit Rome. 

We’ve marched miles through the motorways of Rome on a mission to discover hidden architectural jewels. 

Our path started at the _Santa Maria Maggiore_, an ancient church built under Celestine between 422-432 AD.

Finding ancient buildings that were built as far back as the first century is quite easy in this intoxicating city.

Everything is designed to impress.

Upon undertaking the steep slope of climbing and counting all 174 _Spanish Steps_, we were able to see the Bourbon Spanish Embassy.

The entire central city is saturated with ancient architect and well-kept ruins of the great empire. 

Most spectacular is the _Roman Colosseum._

The Coliseum was completed in 80AD and holds between 50,000 - 70,000 guests, similar to the size of a huge NFL stadium.

Hearing the history while standing inside the marble walls was a priceless educational experience.

However, I’ll regress to prevent this blog from becoming a history lesson. 

You should know that Rome has the absolute most amazing architect of the ancient world. They built astounding arches, the first city sewage system, engineered running water, a mesmerizing marble coliseum and so much more.

Walking along the path of prehistoric marble sidewalks through ancient arches felt somewhat surreal. 

It’s no surprise why 20 million tourists visit Rome every year to see and hear about the dynasty with 700 years of bloody history.

Accurate descriptions have escaped my mind because my thoughts are scattered throughout the crisscrossing street of Rome.

During our first visit 6 years ago, we failed to put in the steps needed to see the magnitude of this place – perhaps our visit was too short.

This time around, we gave ourselves 5 days to observe, learn, relax, shop and eat authentic Italian dishes.

I think we’re addicted to pizza and pasta now – oh, and Italian bread, gelato and did I say pizza and pasta?

Tomorrow, we’ll visit the smallest country on the planet.

Did you know that Vatican City’s boundaries are undisputed even though the country is located entirely within the city of Rome?

We set aside a special day to visit the Vatican museum, Sistine Chapel and St. Peter’s Basilica. 

Afterward, we’ll eat more pizza and pasta, before posting more high resolution pictures for our blog readers.

Meanwhile, enjoy the recent photos we’ve uploaded detailing major landmarks in the riveting city of Rome.

# SECRETS SURROUNDING SWITZERLAND

## (TIME STAMPED: Monday, June 3, 2019/11:45 p.m.)

**TRAVEL BLOG -** We settled into the sunset of stunning Switzerland – with 4,600 feet mountaintops surrounding small towns as the sunlight skips across clear blue lakes.

This wife and daughter and mine are amazingly advanced travelers; they get up early prepared to face the foreign challenges and chaos of the day.

They carry heavy luggage without complaining or causing delays.

They’ve packed lightly, washed clothes, and repacked while in route.

They suggest brilliant tourism ideas – and together we’re having a blast making magical memories.

Some women complain about having husbands that don’t travel, but your family travel team has to have tenacity, grit, spontaneity, social skills, strength and flexibility.

I’d cross the borders of any country with Clara and Amber – we’ve detoured to avoid drama, navigated around negativity, and took high speed trains to evade nonsense.

Thigpen team is now racing to Rome.

Meanwhile, I have to tell you about Zurich, Switzerland. 

For starters, the view is hypnotic; Swiss Alps capped with snow, green pastures, lakeside boat rides, passing trains and historic homes – all within the scope of one glance.

Mere words cannot express the complexity the Creator used with designing this place. 

Describing Switzerland as beautiful is an epic understatement.

We witnessed firsthand, God’s ingenious artistry. 

Next to humanity itself, I’ve never laid naked eyes on anything as intrinsically profound. 

The cobblestone streets, traditional Swiss architecture and European style clock towers with giant bells lined the cityscape. 

Upon arrival, we were greeted like royalty at Hilton, Spreitenbach, which is a wonderfully 2019 designed Hilton located in the suburbs on Zurich.

Front desk receptionists Lisa Moser (Austrian) and Alexander kok (Asian) ensured our comfort with exceptional kindness.

Restaurant supervisor Marcel Albert (German) accommodated our vegan requests, made suggestions and rearranged the menu, had the chef create gourmet recipes to our liking. 

Bar manger Damien Richard (Italian) and bartenders Fabio Mossini (Italian) made us feel like family.

Then there was Jan Schwartzwrpf (Swiss).

He showed us the kind of hospitality meant for kings and queens, we laughed with one another like long lost friends. 

The fact that we barely could speak one another’s languages didn’t seem to matter at all.

I miss everything about Switzerland already. 

The food, the drinks, the view and mostly the kind-hearted and hospitable people.

Clara made tourism arrangements that landed us in the middle of the Lake of Zurich on a fascinating boat tour.

It is a photographer’s dream excursion. 

We walked through the city limits of old town Zurich, the original historic location of where the town started. 

We met a man named Sergio, who volunteered to give us a mini tour of the town, of course we accepted.

Afterward, Clara tipped him a couple Swiss franks. 

Our tour started on Limmat River, which Sergio called one of the largest rivers in Europe.

This wasn’t accurate, although Zurich is the largest city in Switzerland, and the Lake of Zurich is where the Limmat River starts. 

Sergio did give us a lot of valuable historic facts. 

Zürich was founded by the Romans, so perhaps this was the perfect place to visit prior to arriving in Rome. 

The city thrived because of all the markets positioned alongside the river. 

Sergio did share an interesting piece of the untold past that I was able to fact check.

A prominent Catholic priest named Ulrich Zwingli was born in 1484 and martyred by Catholic mercenaries in 1531.

Zurich has 26 Cantons, which are like states in America.

Roman priest Ulrich Zwingli (also known as Huldrych), who possessed extreme rhetoric abilities, was sent to Zurich – a country with 4 official languages.

Places where merchants spoke many languages required a priest like Zwingli to ensure the church’s success.

Soon after his placement, the Roman Catholic Church hired mercenaries, known as the Swiss Mercenary System, to fight for colonies, power, religious rule, and trade in Zurich.

Zwingli was against this church initiative.

As a result, he broke tides with Catholicism and started a reformation movement that evolved into Christian Protestants.

When many Swiss soldiers suffered the Black plague disease, Zwingli was killed on the battlefield because they did not have enough men to stand their ground.

A Zurich statue still stands in his honor, depicting him holding a sword and the Bible.

Sergio’s tourism tips paid off, we learned a lot, and most importantly, he motivated us to do more research while in route to Rome. 

The girls have mounted up, we’re moving out and making our way to southern Italy. 

The adrenalin of rushing to Rome is unmistakable, considering that the ancient ruins of this city is one of our favorite historic sites in the world.

# PLANNING A WORLD CLASS VACATION

## (TIME STAMPED: Sunday, June 2, 2019/10:00 p.m.)

**TRAVEL BLOG -** Supporters across the United States have been following our family travel blog and asking really great questions.

Readers are inspired.

“How and what did you pack for a trip of this magnitude,” asked an Texas enthusiast?

One Illinois reader asked, “Did you hire a travel agent?”

Questions and concerned ranged from when is the best time to exchange currency, how to pick the right hotels, and how to operate in countries that do not speak English.

So, here’s a quick blog to answer a few of those questions.

# Passports

Make sure you have valid identification and passports. If your passport expires in less than 6 months, some countries will not accept it for entry, so double check. 

If you have a child, you will need both parents to sign in order to secure a passport for a minor. 

If you received a passport prior to age 18, you’ll have to apply for a new one as an adult. 

Take a copy of your passport prior to traveling. Keep one in your possession at all times and keep the other with your luggage. 

If you have any concerns while overseas, all you need to do is contact the U.S. Ambassador within the country you are visiting. 

## Plane Tickets

This can be tricky, because everyone has difference preferences. 

When traveling overseas, I prefer to pay the added cost and fly Delta Airlines – this is not an  endorsement of any kind. 

Just remember, loyalty has rewards – frequent flyer miles pay off in the long run.

Also, Delta offers added space, convenience and comfort. 

Whatever you do, remember, traveling overseas is a time consuming experience, and you want your travel accommodations to be as comfy as conceivable. 

Your flight will potentially set the tone for the duration of your trip.

The last option you’ll want is multiple layovers prior to arriving at your final destination.

Initially, it might seem fun landing in various locations, but 2-4 hour layovers don’t give you enough time to leave the airport and sightsee.

The only thing you’ll have is bragging rights to say, “I’ve been there,” but exhaustion, frustration, poor hygiene and less time to actually enjoy your vacation destination. 

I suppose you’ll possibly save a few bucks, but remember, you get what you pay for.

Besides, why spend your time and money on airport meals and security checks, when you can be making lasting memories in a far away place.

To save on cost, check the prices to multiple destinations you’ll visit during your stay.

Afterward, you can alter your travel journey while maintaining the comfort and convenience of a reputable airline. 

Most importantly, purchase your tickets far in advance.

Tickets are usually less expensive early on, and you’ll have a choice of better seating arrangements, especially if traveling with a group of 3 or more. 

You’ll want to sit together, and these instructions will allow you to have a happy wife and a happy life.

## Hotels

Remember what I told you about loyalty?

Whether you stay at Hilton Hotels, Marriott’s, Embassy Suits or whatever your choice is, stick to it.

This option will give you memberships perks, sometimes free breakfast, free night stays, and the convenience of dealing with one franchise, in the event issues arise.

For example, during our recent visit, we had to alter our route because Amsterdam train workers were on strike. 

I simply contacted an English speaking Hilton representative. 

Within minutes, she canceled my non-refundable room (and refunded my credit card), while booking us an additional night stay in Paris, at the same time. 

The transition went wrinkle-free, and we seamlessly rerouted our journey. 

Among other reasons, this is why I prefer American owned hotels. 

When staying at foreign hotels, there’s no guarantee that the concierge will be able to speak your language, make last minute accommodations or provide refunds. 

The rooms are often much smaller, and the food options are even more limited.

A free breakfast at your hotel has the potential to save an awful lot of cash flow to do other tourism activities. 

Our hotel in Switzerland even provided a free laundry room with free detergent, allowing us to wash clothes midstream.

A good quality hotel that you already trust for travel purposes stateside will prove worthwhile when traveling within Europe. 

## Packing for A Long Journey

If you are staying 10-30 days, don’t you dare pack an outfit for each day – pack lightly. 

Remember, you can always wash – you’ll have plenty of time during a 3-4 week trip.

Roll your clothing tightly and store items in zip lock bags during travel. 

This will protect your clothes from spills and excessive wrinkles – it will also allow you to keep the smell of your dirty clothes from your clean clothing.

In fact, I stuff a fresh bounty sheet into all my zip lock bags to keep a fresh fragrance on my clean clothes.

I’m an extremist, but who better to learn from. 

I even pack my bags two weeks prior to departure and weigh it on a digital scale. 

If your international luggage weighs more than 50 pounds, you’re likely to pay an additional $100, going and coming, for the extra weight. 

I combined my luggage with my daughter’s for a duffle bag weighing 47 pounds. 

Considering that I knew I’d been walking in various countries to different speed trains, I did a test run. 

I mounted my luggage on my back and went for an 8-mile walk through my neighborhood. 

Afterward, I had no concerns, knowing that I wouldn’t walk more than 8 miles with luggage while traveling with a wife and a 13-year-old daughter.  

Obviously, women need to take extra (just-in-case) hygiene stuff – especially if your trip is a month long (hint hint).

Other than planning for the expected, aim to under pack, rather than over packing. Wear pants with different shirts more than once – mix it up. 

If traveling in the summer, keep in mind that shorts weigh less and take up less space.

Our current trip is 3 weeks, so everything I’m describing is pretty much based on this trip.

## In Country Traveling

I previously wrote an article called “Tips to Traveling in Country”. Scroll through my Travel Blog and you’ll learn a lot about the Global Eurail Pass that you should purchase months prior to traveling in country. 

The global pass is about $556 for an adult and $427 for a child.

You will still need to pay to reserve seats on certain train lines. 

However, add up your cost prior to traveling, because if you’ll be moving about Europe to more than 3 countries, it’ll be worth the expense. 

Be mindful that your global pass is not the only cost of in country travel. 

Reserving seats is as chap as $12 per person, and sometimes $40 per person, depending on your destination. 

In addition, you’ll have the expense of city tubes, local trains, buses and taxis. 

Count up the cost prior to planning your trip. 

## 21 Day Journey Calculator

(These are approximate rates for Europe). 

Passport ($120) + Airline Tickets ($1500) + Luggage ($500) + Nightly Hotel ($160) + Global Eurail Pass ($560) + Local Commuter Expenses ($50) + Food Expenses ($100) + Tourism Activities ($75) = Total Approximate: $12,765

In essence, you might want to plan to save/spend about $13,000 - $14,000, because unexpected expenses are always likely to arise. 

You don’t want to find yourself stuck in a foreign place broke or having to forfeit comfort and convenience on a family vacation. 

It might sound like a lot, but I was adding up expenses with a friend and we a unique discovery. 

In one year alone, his expenses on liquor, smokes, stateside traveling, and miscellaneous activities, totaled about $6000. 

The choice is yours - we all do what we want to with our income.

Stop calculating other people’s vacation costs and enjoy your own life.

Gain some meaningful world class experiences that you will embrace for a lifetime. 

Perhaps you’ll have to save for season, but now you have all the informaion at your disposal to plan a world class family vacation.

# BYE BYE BARCELONA 

_Switching Scenery from Spain to Switzerland_ 

## (TIME STAMPED: Saturday, June 1, 2019/11:35 p.m.)

**TRAVEL BLOG -** Traveling to 13 countries in one summer is a huge undertaking – I’ve questioned my sanity and still think I’m a genius.

Besides, it’s been said that the definition of insanity is always doing the same thing and expecting a different result. 

Well, European undertaking definitely is no repeat of the same old same old. 

However, I do believe this was my last repeat trip to the capital of Catalonia.

Barcelona is a breathtakingly beautiful place to behold; wine vineyards, the basilica and snow capped mountains are just a few images that leave tourists in awe.

There’s so much more to see than the expected sea shores and beaches.

Here the catch, the natives are naturally rude - not with bad intentions - it seems to be a cultural norm.

They’re not accommodating with lost travelers.

Their food is nothing tasty to write home about. 

They don’t seem to like tourists, to the extent that one native flung a handful of trash toward international guests eating at a nearby restaurant. 

They don’t try to help you with their language, even if you’re spending money in their establishment. 

As a result, there’s no need to tell me where I’m not welcomed as a guest.

Adios Amigo! 

Seriously, I was glad to arrive, and equally glad to say goodbye. 

The Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família is the primary attraction we wanted our daughter to see. 

It is an extremely large almost finished Roman Catholic Church in the heart of Barcelona. 

The church construction has come along way since Clara and I first saw it 6 years ago.

Architect Antonio Gaudi designed the building and it’s been under construction since 1882. 

During the Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939, many of the original gothic architectural plans, and master models were destroyed. 

On the centennial of Guadi’s death, 2026, the church is scheduled for completion. 

It is said to be the most beautiful church in the entire history of art. 

With no uncertainty, the breath-taking building is jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring and mind-mesmerizing.

Pictures don’t quite do it justice, so I took a lot of them, aiming to give readers a better idea of how immaculate and huge the church is. 

Every artistic detail represents history from the Christian religion. 

Much like natural world wonders; the Grand Canyon, Victoria Falls, Mt. Everest and more, manmade masterpieces give birth to continued inspiration. 

We did have great service at a street side restaurant, although to no surprise, the waiter was Italian – nobody knows hospitality and food like Italians.

So, Barcelona is not a bad memory, it’s just not on the top of my list of referrals. 

I left inspired. 

I just prefer more pleasantries when exploring new cultural experiences – that’s why I’m highly anticipating my return to Rome. 

One week has escaped us so quickly - time flies when you’re having fun, especially on vacation. 

Before heading to Italy for the week, we’re spending this weekend in Switzerland. 

(We actually arrived in Switzerland today, we leave on Monday, I’ll post pictures and new blog as content as frequent as time permits).

# TIPS TO TRAVELING COUNTRY TO COUNTRY  

## (TIME STAMPED: Friday, May 31, 2019/5:45 p.m.)

**TRAVEL BLOG -** A multi-destination trip to Europe is for the brave-hearted – it’s exciting, adventurous and daring. 

While doing so, there are a few tedious tips travelers need to heed. 

When leaving places like Paris, heading to Barcelona on these European bullet trains time warping at over 210 miles per hour, there are critical travel tips to consider. 

For starters, restrooms or toilets can be located nearly a mile away from any given spot at a depot. 

So, if you have a weak bladder, plan ahead or wear depends – seriously. 

Also, some restroom cost about 0.80 euros, which is about $1 - keep that in mind.

 It seems like the closer we get to a restroom, psychologically the body relaxes itself – ordinarily that’s a good thing. 

However, the urgency and discomfort of thinking you have access to a toilet, and then suddenly realizing you have no currency at hand can be excruciating.

As you probably sensed, I’ve been there – thankfully, my bladder is strong.

Speaking of strength, don’t anticipate the use of luggage rollers - you will have to carry your luggage throughout your trip when backpacking by Eurail. 

Almost 50 pounds of clothes and toiletries for 2 people during a 3-week stay gave me a greater appreciation for the invention of wheels.

Unfortunately, this left my wife backpacking her own luggage, like a brave-hearted trooper. During our previous trip to Europe together, we traveled to 7 countries by plane, but failed to see the inland regions of the countryside, beyond the tourist attraction.

This particular trip has been priceless.

These rolling hills, mountainsides, green pastures, and beautifully breath-taking views are a sight to see. 

After experiencing both, I definitely suggest traveling by train.

Trains in Europe are very efficient, actually more comfortable, with more amenities and more personal space than airplanes. However, consider purchasing a global pass and visiting multiple countries during your stay – first class preferably.  A global pass will give you the best bang for your buck. We purchased our global Eurail pass online months prior to departure. Although there’s an additional costs for seat reservation on each train.

As a result of purchasing first-class Eurail passes in advance, our seat reservations are usually less than $45 in first-class. Throughout Europe, depending on which country you’re in, you could be on a EuroStar, SNCF or other trains. Much like in America we have Amtrak, Grand Canyon Railways and South-shore Trains. 

Europe merely operates a faster and more sophisticated network of express railways.  When reserving seats, if your party has more than two people, be sure to inform the ticket agent that you’d like to seat across from one another. We have our own private section, hot meals and drinks are served, toilets are in each cart, and outlets, lamps and window shades are provided – sometimes it’s free, but be prepared to pay. 

On overnight trains, you even have the option of purchasing a bed. It’s definitely a one-of-a-kind experience.

Currently, we’re moving at such an accelerated speed (300 km/h), that cars on the expressway barely seem to be moving.

So, you’re probably wondering, “How much was our online Eurail Pass?”

Well, none of your business – just kidding.  Seriously, that all depends on how far in advance you make your purchase.

Also, you will have the option to pay a third party company to make your seat reservations in advance. 

I didn’t. I don’t regret it. However, paying the added fee is likely to be more helpful and eliminate hassles and stress.

Just keep in mind that once you make those purchases, your trip is set in stone.

At that point, there will be an additional cost for spontaneity. 

Once you arrive in country, you’ll notice that these train depots are huge buildings occupied by restaurants, banks, fresh food markets, deli shops, and more. 

There is so much going on – from different dialogues and languages, and military security armed with machine guns, to worldwide travelers taking trains that look like torpedoes.

Pardon me, as I continue gazing amid these picturesque views and soaking up the sensation of serenity.

I’ll write a separate blog about Barcelona in my next post and add some panoramic photos of Spain into my full gallery.

Remember, after all your research, Europe is a well connected Continent of 44 countries, and you’ll definitely want to visit more than just one upon crossing the Atlantic Ocean. 

Meanwhile, as we continue to commute throughout various countries, our first-hand tips are sure to save researchers and readers lots of cash and concern.

# PARIS NEVER SLEEPS

## (TIME STAMPED: Thursday, May 30, 2019/11:30 a.m.)

**TRAVEL BLOG -**   France’s capital city and global center of love, art, fashion, cooking, good food and culture is simply breath-taking. 

The 19th century city design is crisscrossed with boulevards aligned with bouquets and the Seine River. 

It has so many landmarks aside from the Eiffel Tower. 

Visitors could enjoy an entire vacation here alone. After 3 days, it’s now time for us to venture off to Barcelona, Spain. 

As for Paris, 2 most important things you need to know and 2 most important places you must go. For starters, be prepared to walk. 

It’s so much you’ll never see or experience it you don’t venture off the beaten path.  I know firsthand. 

The previous trip my wife and I enjoyed in Paris, we didn’t nearly walk or see as much. You’ve got to put on those walking shoes to see the hidden jewels of the world! 

Don’t be afraid to leave the tourist areas and see how the French truly live.  We sure did, day and night! 

One New Yorker we witnessed unsuccessfully trying to order “deep fried chicken” at a small curbside French cuisine restaurant - not ideal people. 

Try new things - allow yourself to be vulnerable enough to experiment outside your culture and comfort zone. Of course, stay within your dietary expectations. 

Our diet is vegan, the time in Arizona is 11 hours behind, we don’t speak or read French, we don’t know anyone here and we are 5,500 miles away from our U.S. home. 

That didn’t stop us from being adventurous - Clara and Amber are troopers. 

 I love traveling with my bold and daring family - we care about one another while being adventurous. 

Secondly, don’t come to Paris broke. This place isn’t necessarily as expensive as London, but there’s so much more to do without leaving the city limits. 

As promised, I better mention those two places you absolutely must go in Paris. 

You shouldn’t come this far without at least feeling the energy of exploring the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum. 

For the duration of our journey, we’ll be spending European currency, which makes it easier not having to make exchange. 

Remember, in London we used Pounds. Every country we’re visiting has a different language, food choices, music and overall culture.  

So, instead of comparing place-to-place, we are embracing every experience independently!  

However, I admit I’m biased, Italy is my favorite tourism place on the planet, next to countries in Africa – ultimately, there’s no place like home! 

For now, off to Spain we go.

# THE FASHION, FUN AND EIFFEL TOWER OF PARIS

## (TIME STAMPED: Wednesday, May 29, 2019/10:04 p.m.)

**TRAVEL BLOG -**    I don’t have long because our night isn’t over and we’re heading for a Paris-style late evening meal.

These people in Paris do not rest.

Today was somewhat relaxing, aside from walking over 8 miles.

We slept in late, navigated on city transportation to the Eiffel Tower and then went straight to eat.

All day, everywhere I looked was a photo opportunity. 

We did lots of sightseeing and very little shopping. 

Clara guided us to the most famous French monument in Paris called Arc de Triomphe. It commemorates and honors those who fought and died in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. 

In case you didn’t know, the Revolutionary Wars were a series of conflicts that lasted from 1792 – 1802. These wars pitted France against Great Britain, Austria, Prussia and Russia. 

The Napoleonic Wars of 1803-1815 were conflicts lead by Napoleon I, which caused European powers to form into various coalitions.

Every time I think of Napoleon, I imagine powerful people who have the “short man’s syndrome”.

At any rate, I’ll tell you more about our Paris experience tomorrow. 

I gotta go – Paris await my presence!

# CHANGE OF PLANS 

##   (TIME STAMPED: Tuesday, May 28, 2019/11:45 p.m.)

**TRAVEL BLOG -**    We are in Paris now. Let me explain.

So, today, we discovered that the European International Train workers in Amsterdam are on strike. 

Thankfully, the strike started before we were in the Netherlands, and not stuck there. 

At any rate, change of plans. I quickly re-routed our journey, booked new transportation to Paris, skipping Belgium and Amsterdam. 

No worries, because we have a surprise country we’re adding to our trip – we’ll share that with you later.

In the meanwhile, we get to spend an extra day and a half in Paris.

I could sense that Clara and Amber needed a little rest after three days of nonstop traveling – and so did I. 

So, this is a good thing. This is exactly what I meant by enjoying the experience of having absolutely no sense of “real” responsibility. 

It feels great to just go with the flow, enjoying every minute while seeing the world first class.

Considering that I prearranged my cellular services ahead of time, and booked only Hilton Hotels, when contacting Hilton to change my accommodations, I already had a little leverage.

The canceled previously paid for hotels, refunded every dime and booked new hotels without any inconvenience to us.

While holding the line as the customer service representative resolved my change of itinerary, the calming song that played was “Keep Your Head to the Sky” by Earth, Wind and Fire. 

Afterward, we stayed in London during an added day trip and arrive in Paris a day early, with the convenience of adding a day to the front end of the same hotel we’d previously booked anyway!

We traveled first-class on Eurostar railways at 334 km, that’s 207 miles per hour – so in less than 2 hours we arrived at our Paris destination, which was over 300 miles from Central London. 

I’ll have so many pictures of Paris to share after our tours of the Eifel Tower and the Louvre Museum tomorrow.

For now, I have to get some rest – this is definitely the best trip ever, aside from my honeymoon, of course! 

For those of you that are dreaming of coming to Paris one day – see you in your dreams.

# LONDON, ENGLAND  (The UK)  

## (TIME STAMPED: Monday, May 27, 2019/11:38 p.m.)

**TRAVEL BLOG -**   So, we landed in London. 

With a sense of freedom from responsibility mixed with the anxiety of being a foreigner, we secured our luggage, some Pounds (UK Currency), maneuvered to our nearby hotel and purchased Oyster Cards to navigate around beautiful England. My best friend, Ernest, and his lifelong love, Sunny, just happened to be in London as well. 

So, of course we had to hang out for dinner and drinks! 

We reminisced at a tasty restaurant in Central London called, Jinjuu, located at 15 Kingly St, Soho, London W1B 5PS. 

The food there is amazing, including the gourmet vegan options! We shared stories with Amber about what we call “the good old days”! 

It doesn’t seem that long ago when cellular phones didn’t exist, mailing letters was the norm, long distance calls were costly, phones were rotary, TV went off at midnight and the southward shift of R&B lyrics changed the landscaping of our generation. 

The evening spiraled upward with lots of laughter and countless connections that made our experience in London all the more enriching. 

Afterward, we continued sightseeing and navigating the London public transportation system, which is not cheap.

London is very unique in that it’s government is a long established monarchy! 

Much like the U.S. prints the faces of deceased Presidents on our bills, London’s currency is adorned with the presiding Queen. It has a rich meaningful history to many Americans, because the founders of the United States explored the new world only with permission of the monarch. 

So much of our country has roots in their history, even the genetic ancestry of Anglo Saxons. 

Our English language, infrastructure, culture and so much of our history is rooted in British concepts. 

In many aspects, perhaps that’s not a bad thing.

The long standing structures, cobblestone streets, old brick houses, aged traditions, ancient aesthetics and stone sculptured monuments represent the reality that the British take pride in their country’s rich history. 

It suddenly clicked.

My daughter recognized how England once influenced America.

She echoed a popular line from her 5th grade play, which was over 2 years ago, “The British are coming the British are coming”. 

Our overseas visit made everything suddenly add up.

While America fought for its independence, we will never break-free from the culture that is entangled into the fibers of our constitutional values and historic landmarks. 

The monuments and memories of London are a reminder of American history at its onset. Today was an amazing experience. 

We may have landed, but it feels like our feet haven’t touched the ground – we’re having a blast!

# TRAVELING WITH TEAM THIGPEN

Summer Family Vacations to Hotspots in Europe

## (TIME STAMPED: Sunday, May 26, 2019/11 a.m.)

**TRAVEL BLOG -**    After one year of planning, securing passports, conducting research, purchasing plane and train tickets, booking hotel rooms in 13 countries, it is time to take flight.

Our flight is about to depart in less than 2 hours; Clara, Amber and myself are at Delta Airline’s gate F8 ready to see the world. 

Traveling is important to us!

“It’s a gateway to explore about culture, history and people,” said Clara Thigpen. “I’ve always been fascinated with other cultures because they are different from mine.”

As a family, we are humbled and grateful to have the opportunity and privilege to be able to travel to various continents – we don’t take it for granted. 

“I get to learn about history from around the world by actually seeing it hands-on,” Amber said. “A lot of what we see and do in American is based on European history.”

Authentic experiences outside of the textbook is what Clara and I hope to gift our daughter with.

“It’s one thing to read about it or see it on TV,” Clara said. “It’s a different kind of experience when you can see things in real life.”

Travel with us on this journey as we share our experiences and pictures through this Paideia-Tribune blog.  

As a family, we each created individual travel scrapbooks, packed lightly, and planned for the best and the worst, knowing that everything is going to work on our behalf. 

Check-in with us, simply by clicking this same link daily, as we plan to date and time stamp something exciting for you to see and read from 13 uniquely different countries.

So, use google maps to join our journey to the following places: London, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Croatia, Hungary, Austria, Czech Republic, Berlin and Luxembourg. 

We’ve started our morning travel day with some nondairy Starbucks, of course vegan French fries and hydrating water. Listening to some Daniel Ceasar, watching planes take off, and ready to depart the beautiful blue skies of Arizona.

It’s time to go, we’ll chat with you guys on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean - Ready, set, let-go!
