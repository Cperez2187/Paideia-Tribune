# CHANGE OF PLANS 

“Keep Your Head to the Sky”  

## (STAMPED May 28, 2019/11:45 p.m.) 

We are in Paris now. Let me explain.

So, today, we discovered that the European International Train workers in Amsterdam are on strike. 

Thankfully, the strike started before we were in the Netherlands, and not stuck there. 

At any rate, change of plans. I quickly re-routed our journey, booked new transportation to Paris, skipping Belgium and Amsterdam. 

No worries, because we have a surprise country we’re adding to our trip – we’ll share that with you later.

In the meanwhile, we get to spend an extra day and a half in Paris.

I could sense that Clara and Amber needed a little rest after three days of nonstop traveling – and so did I. 

So, this is a good thing. This is exactly what I meant by enjoying the experience of having absolutely no sense of “real” responsibility. 

It feels great to just go with the flow, enjoying every minute while seeing the world first class.

Considering that I prearranged my cellular services ahead of time, and booked only Hilton Hotels, when contacting Hilton to change my accommodations, I already had a little leverage.

The canceled previously paid for hotels, refunded every dime and booked new hotels without any inconvenience to us.

While holding the line as the customer service representative resolved my change of itinerary, the calming song that played was “Keep Your Head to the Sky” by Earth, Wind and Fire. 

Afterward, we stayed in London during an added day trip and arrive in Paris a day early, with the convenience of adding a day to the front end of the same hotel we’d previously booked anyway!

We traveled first-class on Eurostar railways at 334 km, that’s 207 miles per hour – so in less than 2 hours we arrived at our Paris destination, which was over 300 miles from Central London. 

I’ll have so many pictures of Paris to share after our tours of the Eifel Tower and the Louvre Museum tomorrow.

For now, I have to get some rest – this is definitely the best trip ever, aside from my honeymoon, of course! 

For those of you that are dreaming of coming to Paris one day – see you in your dreams.

# LONDON, ENGLAND 

Touring the United Kingdom  

## (STAMPED May 27, 2019/11:38 p.m.) 

So, we landed in London. 

With a sense of freedom from responsibility mixed with the anxiety of being a foreigner, we secured our luggage, some Pounds (UK Currency), maneuvered to our nearby hotel and purchased Oyster Cards to navigate around beautiful England. My best friend, Ernest, and his lifelong love, Sunny, just happened to be in London as well. 

So, of course we had to hang out for dinner and drinks! 

We reminisced at a tasty restaurant in Central London called, Jinjuu, located at 15 Kingly St, Soho, London W1B 5PS. 

The food there is amazing, including the gourmet vegan options! We shared stories with Amber about what we call “the good old days”! 

It doesn’t seem that long ago when cellular phones didn’t exist, mailing letters was the norm, long distance calls were costly, phones were rotary, TV went off at midnight and the southward shift of R&B lyrics changed the landscaping of our generation. 

The evening spiraled upward with lots of laughter and countless connections that made our experience in London all the more enriching. 

Afterward, we continued sightseeing and navigating the London public transportation system, which is not cheap.

London is very unique in that it’s government is a long established monarchy! 

Much like the U.S. prints the faces of deceased Presidents on our bills, London’s currency is adorned with the presiding Queen. It has a rich meaningful history to many Americans, because the founders of the United States explored the new world only with permission of the monarch. 

So much of our country has roots in their history, even the genetic ancestry of Anglo Saxons. 

Our English language, infrastructure, culture and so much of our history is rooted in British concepts. 

In many aspects, perhaps that’s not a bad thing.

The long standing structures, cobblestone streets, old brick houses, aged traditions, ancient aesthetics and stone sculptured monuments represent the reality that the British take pride in their country’s rich history. 

It suddenly clicked.

My daughter recognized how England once influenced America.

She echoed a popular line from her 5th grade play, which was over 2 years ago, “The British are coming the British are coming”. 

Our overseas visit made everything suddenly add up.

While America fought for its independence, we will never break-free from the culture that is entangled into the fibers of our constitutional values and historic landmarks. 

The monuments and memories of London are a reminder of American history at its onset. Today was an amazing experience. 

We may have landed, but it feels like our feet haven’t touched the ground – we’re having a blast!

# TRAVELING WITH TEAM THIGPEN 

Summer Family Vacations to Hotspots in Europe

## (STAMPED May 26, 2019/11 a.m.)

After one year of planning, securing passports, conducting research, purchasing plane and train tickets, booking hotel rooms in 13 countries, it is time to take flight.

Our flight is about to depart in less than 2 hours; Clara, Amber and myself are at Delta Airline’s gate F8 ready to see the world. 

Traveling is important to us!

“It’s a gateway to explore about culture, history and people,” said Clara Thigpen. “I’ve always been fascinated with other cultures because they are different from mine.”

As a family, we are humbled and grateful to have the opportunity and privilege to be able to travel to various continents – we don’t take it for granted. 

“I get to learn about history from around the world by actually seeing it hands-on,” Amber said. “A lot of what we see and do in American is based on European history.”

Authentic experiences outside of the textbook is what Clara and I hope to gift our daughter with.

“It’s one thing to read about it or see it on TV,” Clara said. “It’s a different kind of experience when you can see things in real life.”

Travel with us on this journey as we share our experiences and pictures through this Paideia-Tribune blog.  

As a family, we each created individual travel scrapbooks, packed lightly, and planned for the best and the worst, knowing that everything is going to work on our behalf. 

Check-in with us, simply by clicking this same link daily, as we plan to date and time stamp something exciting for you to see and read from 13 uniquely different countries.

So, use google maps to join our journey to the following places: London, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Croatia, Hungary, Austria, Czech Republic, Berlin and Luxembourg. 

We’ve started our morning travel day with some nondairy Starbucks, of course vegan French fries and hydrating water. Listening to some Daniel Ceasar, watching planes take off, and ready to depart the beautiful blue skies of Arizona.

It’s time to go, we’ll chat with you guys on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean - Ready, set, let-go!
