**Reader Focused Writing**, *Words to Write By* – I’m a educated linguist and experienced writer. There are better writers and more experienced linguists out there than me; let’s just get that out of the way now. 

Fortunately, for me, the world’s greatest wordsmiths don’t have a monopoly on the art of communication. 
 
Something in our most recent news cycles is troubling me. I’m not political, but all this he-said-she-said is inflammatory rhetoric, communication barriers and xenophobia. 

To me the common ground of social disagreement is evident: miscommunication and misinterpretation of language’s most basic systems, either intentionally or otherwise. 

It appears as though, as a society, we’ve resorted to picking apart each other’s language, without analyzing the language itself. That’s what I’m here to discuss – language itself.

Language is the basis for all human communication. Seemingly, that’s obvious. 

However, it is important for us to understand this basis before we can dissect the role that language has in our everyday lives. 

We can attribute an overwhelming proportion of social issues that we face in our everyday lives to miscommunications our misunderstandings. 

These issues reflect how language works and how different styles of language interact with one another. We can base much of the framework of human psychology as a whole on the act of language and its role within our social constructs. 

Language permeates through everything we do: every thought we have, every interpretation of information gathered through our physical senses. Every argument, battle, treaty and marriage began and end because of something one person communicated to another. Language, whether written, verbal or nonverbal, is the human vehicle for communication.

I love language. 

It’s delicate and robust and ever changing. It is our greatest social advantage when we know exactly how to use it and our most painful hindrance when we don’t. 

It is complex in and of itself. 

Yet language easily simplifies problems that we thought needed complex solutions. Ultimately, most ambiguous strategies require a linguistic understanding.

We live in a period where people are fixated on the effects of societal perceptions of problems: racism, sexism, intolerance of gender and sexuality. 

There is obvious validity in these issues. To what extent they affect our societies is the question, be it negative or positive, depending on point of view. 

I am interested in how the use of language affects the perceptions, delivery, and reception of these societal factors.

Language itself is unbiased.

It serves only as a vehicle for us to voice our opinions, tell stories, and whatever else we choose to communicate. By simply manipulating the order of words or stressing different emphases within our sentences we can convey any kind of message we want.

With this platform, I hope to share some basic, uncommon knowledge of linguistic systems.

To which end, I anticipate unveiling a better understanding of what is being said in our cultures and how those messages are being delivered. 

I believe it is vital to the success of our society that we are able to understand each other and share information and opinions effectively. 

People that are better communicators will be the driving force to create a more cohesive culture.
