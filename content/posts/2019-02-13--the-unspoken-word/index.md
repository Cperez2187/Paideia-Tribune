The Unspoken Word is epic poetry depicting difficult to discuss realities that mainstream society shuns. 

Many of these topics, the media, churches and social groups continue to avoid and overlook, as a result, our communities suffer.

I’ve been called “an accomplished and clever author,” although my traditional writing style of epic poetry is intended to inspire audiences to give ear to non-traditional pandemics. 

Spoken word poetry paints engaging narratives of uncelebrated lives, and that is what this book is all about.  

As a poet, I possess a deep passion to liberate the lost. 

The Unspoken Word is an artistic collection of inexplicable lifestyles written to educate, empower and entertain.

**THE UNSPOKEN WORD** challenges readers in effort to create change.

I’ve travel the world, hoping to impact globally, because my heart is truly driven by the desire to uplift individuals regardless of race, religion, color or creed. 

Travel with me on this poetic journey as I give new meaning and life to a world of people who are disgraced and denied dignity.
