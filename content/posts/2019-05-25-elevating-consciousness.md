THE THINK TANK, Elevating Consciousness – Heartless people are pledging to the platitude that “God will not place more on you than you can handle.” 

If God doesn’t, then life does – either way, no one is interested in semantics when life is whirling out of control. In effort to cope, people are abusing prescription meds, illegal drugs, and excessive alcohol.

Albeit, preachers and parishioners twist words to tickle the ears of listeners, pacifying serious concerns, and gaining undo respect – in that order.

Most people spit out this thoughtless cliché because it sounds good during difficult times. Even worse, some churchgoers think this quote is a noteworthy Bible scripture – it’s not a verse.

Yet, people continue belting out, “God will not place more on you than you can handle,” remains a reliable escape from assuming responsibility of helping others.

The inescapable truth is that life is bound with burdens.

Everyday about 3000 people commit suicide worldwide, and for every individual who takes their own life, 20 others make an attempt. Unfortunately, I’ve personally had a childhood friend to commit suicide and a few adult associates who attempted.

Without question, like most of us, they had to deal with more than they could handle.

Instead of humanizing individuals with empathy, users of this cliché push them further into isolation.

Hurting people need empathy, not apathy.

When dealing with extreme difficulties and embarrassing differences, super spiritual clichés have no substance.

To my own shame, I recall using this non-biblical reference many times.

This article is a reflection of my wake-up call. It’s also my formal apology to individuals who needed my support and received a passive cliché instead.

Life will indeed put more on you than you can handle, if you allow it. Accepting this reality empowers individuals to build strong support systems prior to crisis.

Crisis, tragedy and brokenness causes us to create connections or retreat inwardly into unhealthy isolation, paranoia and doubt.

Perhaps it would be best if we would sensibly redefine this cliché with words more theologically or psychologically sound.

Whether you’re a nonbeliever or believer, life will burden you with obstacles and challenges.

Logical individuals share similar strategies to solve problems and manifest solutions. Two are better than one – people are stronger together – we need one another.

I’ve listened as individuals confided concerning pregnancies, abortions, diseases, divorces, miscarriages, infertility, indiscretions, bankruptcies, financial pitfalls, depression, irreconcilable families, dysfunctional behaviors, and abusive relationships.

At their lowest moment; eyes clouded with tears, and minds congested with thoughts of desperation, how we respond impacts lives forever. I dare not degrade, devalue, or diminish their anguish with a deceptive cliché.

“I’m praying for you,” and It’ll be alright,” are useless platitudes unless we’ve exhausted every strategy to offer help.

Confession and discussion during life’s turmoil is our natural necessity to cope as cohorts.

The cliché, “God will not place more on you than you can handle,” is an excuse to send someone away empty-handed and broken hearted.

Imagine abandoning the wounded on the battlefield saying, “Hang in there,” or the hungry and homeless with disingenuous prayers on the street.

Let’s face it, we need one another – no individual is island to himself – some battles aren’t intended for us to face alone. Get professional help, phone a friend, or pray before proceeding. Always remember that struggle is normal, but be vulnerable enough to get support.

When people cry out for your help, don’t send them away coping with more than they can handle.
