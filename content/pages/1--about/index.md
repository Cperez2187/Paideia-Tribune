### THE VISION:

Paideia is a philosophical practice used for subject-based instruction derived from ancient Greece cultures. The word “Tribune” means champion of the people. The Paideia Tribune is a melting pot of nationwide blog writers contributing towards a holistic approach of cultural wellness. Our mission is to serve as champions of logic strengthening communities from seven perspectives; spiritually, physically, socially, emotionally, intellectually, occupationally, and environmentally.

> “Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That’s why it’s so hard,” said Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David McCullough.

### FUTURE BOOK PUBLICATIONS

Paideia Tribune chronicles every article while formatting ongoing manuscripts for each writer. Our mission is to promote critical thinking, raise awareness and consciousness through constructive, objective, and logical literature. We aim to transform ordinary thinkers into extraordinary authors. We strategize at archiving edited materials to publish each blog writer on Amazon and everywhere books are sold within 12-18 months.
